# Todo list

This is a REST API, made with Ruby on Rails, for managing a Todo list. <br />
It uses ActiveRecord for CRUD operations and JWT for authentication.

Described below are the functionalities we created: <br />
**POST /signup   &ensp; Signup <br />
POST /auth/login   &ensp; Login <br />
GET /auth/logout &ensp;   Logout <br />
GET /todos  &ensp;  List all todos <br />
POST /todos  &ensp;  Create a new todo <br />
GET /todos/:id   &ensp; Get a todo <br />
PUT /todos/:id  &ensp;  Update a todo <br />
DELETE /todos/:id  &ensp;  Delete a todo and its items <br />
GET /todos/:id/items  &ensp;  Get a todo item <br />
PUT /todos/:id/items &ensp;   Update a todo item <br />
DELETE /todos/:id/items  &ensp;  Delete a todo item <br />**

We developed the 'main' branch locally (using an Ubuntu terminal) with SQlite3 as our database. <br />
Meanwhile, the 'heroku' branch has some needed changes (most notably using PostgreSQL instead of SQlite3) in order to be able to be deployed on heroku. <br />

This was made as a university project, and meant for learning about RESTful API development.  <br />
